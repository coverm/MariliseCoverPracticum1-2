 ## 2. Project Resources
### DIV2KDataset
 The DIV2K dataset is a popular benchmark dataset for image super-resolution tasks. It consists of 800 high-resolution images (2560x2048 pixels) and  their corresponding low-resolution versions (1280x1024 pixels). 
 The images are diverse in content, covering a wide range of scenes and objects.

### FSRCNN: A Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network
 FSRCNN (Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network) is a deep learning architecture specifically designed for image super-resolution tasks.    It's known for its efficiency and speed compared to other super-resolution methods, making it a popular choice for real-time applications.
